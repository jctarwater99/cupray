Installing React native for Developing
	> node -v 		// (if version is less than 12.14.1 or dne, update it, good luck)
	> npm install -g expo-cli
			// Also install expo client app on mobile phone

	Creating a new project is done by running
	> expo init <nameOfProject>

Installing Firebase for notifications

	Just watch this. Might go through later and update the relevant files that need to be 
	changed along with the installation to make it work. If not, just putting the link 
	here is easier than saying run these 3 commands and update these 6 files by pasting 
	these 20 lines and blah blah blah


Installing React native navigation for multiple screens?
	> npm install @react-navigation/native
	> expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view
	
	// Alternative equivalent to "expo install..." line
	// npm install react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view
	// For mac and IOS
	> npx pod-install ios
