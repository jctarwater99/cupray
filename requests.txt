Safe Ending
With all the covid craziness, I just pray that everyone (especially myself, lol) would be able to finish this semester strongly
Senior Design
That I would not worry about deadlines and finishing in time but rather that I would be diligent and make sure veryone on the team knows what to do and is getting stuff done.
Contentment
That I wouldn't complain as much since God is good despite the inconveniences
Consistency in the word
We make time for the things we value, that God would put a desire in me to know Him and a sense of urgency so that I will be motivated to spend daily time in the word meditating.
I need a servant's heart!
Lord, there are a lot of times when I feel the urge to think only of myself. Could you give me a servant's heart so that I can honor you with my life?
Motivation
Heavenly Father, ....covid sucks. Please help it to end, and help me to stay motivated despite all the demotivating factors surrounding covid.
Loving/aware
I know that I cna be more blunt or rude than I intend to be. Please help me to communicate more lovingly with those around me and to be aware of the impact that my words can have.
