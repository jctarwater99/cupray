I am from New Hampshire which is known for being a spiritual desert in the country. Every year more and more Christian schools (and churches) shrink or shut down. Pray that God would sustain the institutions that are faithful and that He would open peopleâ€™s hearts locally and in the government to know Him and see the need for Christian schools and churches.
