My Aunt and Uncle own a Christian school in Lebanon where muslim and refugee children attend and get a chance to hear the gospel. Please pray for their safety since the Lebanese government/economy has struggled during covid. And pray that the hearts of the children and their parents will be opened to the Gospel through the teachers at the school.
